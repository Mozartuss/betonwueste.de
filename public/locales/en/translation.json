  "Datasets": "In order to be able to calculate land consumption from 1980 to 2020, several data sets were used. Two different systems were used: the Automatisierte Liegenschaftsbuchs (ALB) from 1980 to 201b and the Amtliche Liegenschaftskatasterinformationssystem (ALKIS®) since 2014. The use of two data sets was necessary because in Bavaria the ALB has been replaced by ALKIS® since 2014.",
